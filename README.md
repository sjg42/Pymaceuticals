# Pymaceuticals

## Overview
For this project, I pretended to be a senior data analyst at a pharmaceuitical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. My hypothetical company (Pymaceuticals) conducted a clinical study with the purpose of comparing the performance their drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens on mice. My goal was to generate tables and visualizations needed for a technical report.


## Work Completed
* Imported data into Pandas Dataframe
* Generated Summary Statistics
* Created various plots/visualizations with Matplotlib in order to pull insights from the data
* Calculated the correlation coefficient and createed a linear regression model comparing mouse weight to average tumor volume of the Capomulin mice population.
